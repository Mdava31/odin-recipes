    <h2>Healthy Avocado and Roti Dish.</h2>
    <p>
        Chef Shankari Arcot teaches cooking classes online and in person.<br>  
        She developed this variation of a classic roti/chapati to use California Avocado<br>
        in place of ghee. Not only does it make these quick flatbreads vegan,<br> 
        but it makes them more nutrient-dense.

        and sourced locally.

    <ul>
        <li>1 ripe, Fresh California Avocado, pitted and peeled</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups whole wheat flour</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp. salt</li>
        <li>Warm water, as needed</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil, as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h2>Steps of making our dish.</h2>
    <p>
        The following are the steps of making our delicious dish.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, mash the avocado to a fine paste.</li>
        <li>Add 2 cups of the flour and the salt.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough, sprinkling in warm water until the dough<br> 
            is pliable and doesnâ€™t stick to your fingers.</li>
        <li>Coat the dough with oil and cover it with plastic wrap.<br> 
            Set aside at room temperature for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>To bake, divide the dough into 12 equal portions and<br> 
            round them into small balls.</li>
        <li>Dredge each ball in some of the remaining flour and flatten with your palms.<br> 
            Roll them thinly on a floured surface to about 6 in. diameter and 1/8 in. thick.</li>
        <li>Heat a cast-iron skillet or flat top over medium. Lightly coat it with oil.</li>
        <li>Per order, cook 2 roti at a time. Toast them until small bubbles appear <br>
            on the top surface. Turn them over and cook until the bottom is lightly browned. <br> 
            Rotate the roti on the surface to keep them from sticking.</li>
        <li>Transfer the roti to a plate and cover with a towel to keep warm.</li>
    </ol>
