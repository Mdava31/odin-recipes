    <p>
        We know you love it, but consider replacing it with sorghum or <br>
        finger millet pap, which is nutritious, unprocessed, and keeps <br>
        you full for longer.

    <h2>Steps of making our Delicious Dish</h2>
    <p>
        Here is a method of making our delicious dish.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>To make the ting, place 375g mabele in a plastic container <br>
            and stir in enough water to form a paste. Seal and allow to <br>
            ferment overnight.</li>
        <li>Bring the water to a boil in a saucepan. Mix the maize meal into <br>
            the fermented mabele.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the mixture to the boiling water (make sure water is boiling), <br>
            stirring to break up any lumps. Once thickened, cover and cook for 10 minutes <br>
            over a medium heat.</li>
        <li>Using a wooden spoon, stir and turn the pap to break up any lumps that may <br>
            have formed. Cook for a further 20 minutes. Once cooked, use the wooden spoon <br>
            to shape into rounds before serving.</li>
        <li>To make the tshohlo, slice the meat and onion. Place in a large saucepan with <br>
            the remaining ingredients. Cook for 2–3 hours, or until tender. Season with salt <br>
            and pepper. Drain any liquid and shred. Serve with the ting.</li>
    </ol>
